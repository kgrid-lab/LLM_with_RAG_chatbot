      "Alcohol cessation",
      "Alcohol cessation (also known as quitting alcohol or stopping alcohol use) refers to the process of discontinuing the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Alcohol is a psychoactive substance that can lead to addiction and dependence, making the cessation process challenging. Withdrawal symptoms can occur when alcohol use is abruptly stopped, which may require medical support for some individuals."
